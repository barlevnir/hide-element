# Privacy Policy for Element Hider

**Last Updated: November 24, 2024**

## Overview

Element Hider is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension handles (and importantly, does not handle) user data.

## Key Points

- We do not collect any personal information
- We do not transmit any data to external servers
- All data is stored locally on your device only
- You have complete control over your data

## Data Storage and Usage

### What We Store Locally

The extension stores only:
- CSS selectors of elements you choose to hide
- The website domains (hostnames) where elements are hidden

This data is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage (chrome.storage.local) and never leaves your device.

### How We Use Local Data

The stored data is used solely to:
- Remember which elements you've chosen to hide on specific websites
- Automatically re-apply your hiding preferences when you revisit websites
- Enable the "Restore all hidden elements" feature

### Data Control

You can easily remove all stored data by:
- Using the "Restore all hidden elements" feature on each website
- Clearing your browser's extension storage
- Uninstalling the extension

## Data Collection

We do NOT collect:
- Personal information (names, emails, etc.)
- Health information
- Financial information
- Authentication details
- Personal communications
- Location data
- Web browsing history
- User activity (clicks, scrolling, keystrokes)
- Website content (text, images, media)

## Data Transmission

The extension NEVER:
- Sends data to external servers
- Communicates with third-party services
- Tracks user behavior
- Monitors browsing activity

## Updates to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and provide notification through the Chrome Web Store.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy or our privacy practices, please submit them through the Chrome Web Store support channel for Element Hider.

## User Rights

You have the right to:
- Know what data is stored locally
- Control your data through the extension's features
- Delete all stored data at any time
- Uninstall the extension and remove all associated data

## Technical Details

For transparency, here's how data is handled technically:

1. Data Storage Format:
   - Data is stored as simple key-value pairs in chrome.storage.local
   - Keys are website hostnames (e.g., "example.com")
   - Values are arrays of CSS selectors for hidden elements

2. Data Scope:
   - Limited to the current browser profile
   - Isolated to the extension's storage space
   - Not shared between different browsers or devices

3. Data Persistence:
   - Survives browser restarts
   - Cleared on extension uninstall
   - Can be manually cleared at any time

## Compliance

This extension is designed to respect user privacy and comply with:
- Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) principles

By using Element Hider, you can be confident that your privacy is protected, as no personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted beyond your local device.
